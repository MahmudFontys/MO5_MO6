TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

The latch debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#31 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#32 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#33 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debug_module_i/seg_buff_0/U0/buff_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin debug_module_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0, clkfbout_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin debug_module_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0, clk_out1_debug_module_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 33 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
