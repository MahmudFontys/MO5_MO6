WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net debug_module_i/echo_analyzer_0/U0/counter_reset_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debug_module_i/echo_analyzer_0/U0/counter_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell debug_module_i/echo_analyzer_0/U0/counter_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
